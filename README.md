# XPLNEDSF
Python script for reading and writing X-Plane dsf-files

Warning: This code is currently still in development. 
         You may encounter errors. Use with care....
         
The class XLPNEDSF has functions to read and write X-Plane dsf-files (currently only if they are unzipped).
After a file was read. Details of the dsf files can be processed and changed and then written back to a new dsf file.

For the moment only changes to 16-BIT Vertex Pools are changed to new files. 
However, this is enough to change the height of vertices in a specified area.
This is demonstrated by the script dsfVertexTool.py.

Work in progress....
